 Test task: Development of an interactive presentation for Onpoint.ru made on JavaScript and PHP.

[ TASK ]

You must create two presentation slides with resolution: 1024 x 768. 
Description of slides:

- Slide 1
The initial state of the slide. Note the pill on the left and the sick man. On the slide there is a slider â€“ it has a position on the scale which can be moved. It is accordingly reflected on the highlighted figure. There is also a button selection: day - week - month. Thus, the client can choose the number of patients in a certain time period.
Also, the user should be able to "pick up" the pill and drag it to the grandfather. This means a real drag and drop, not a button followed by a pre-programmed animation. When the pill is transferred to the area of the grandfather's head, his image is replaced by a new picture of healthy grandfather.

- Slide 2
Should display the same slider position and clamped button that were on the previous slide. I.e. values have to be written somewhere, and then to be reproduced for this slide, thus not to be interactive (if you try to move something here - nothing should move because the data is set on the previous slide).

Transition between slides is made using arrows.
